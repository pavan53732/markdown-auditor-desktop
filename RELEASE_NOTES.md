# Release Notes

## v1.5.0

Release date: 2026-03-29

This release completes the major taxonomy refactor, moving from prompt-defined heuristics to a fully structured, metadata-driven analysis engine. 

### Highlights

- **Full Structured Detector Catalog**: All 256 detectors are now defined in code (`src/lib/detectorMetadata.js`) with explicit trigger patterns, evidence requirements, and false-positive guards.
- **Dynamic Prompt Generation**: The system prompt is now built programmatically, ensuring the AI receives precise, consistent instructions derived from the latest metadata.
- **Domain-Aware Analysis**: New Domain Profiles (API Docs, Runbooks, PRDs, etc.) allow users to adjust analysis emphasis based on document type.
- **Enhanced Observability**: New Taxonomy Diagnostics block in the UI and Markdown exports provide real-time metrics on enrichment, ID parsing, and severity clamping.
- **Regression Safety**: A comprehensive Vitest suite now covers the entire taxonomy, normalization, and validation pipeline.

### Included Improvements

- **Subcategory Support**: Deeper taxonomy with explicit subcategories for all 32 layers.
- **Truthful Loading Metrics**: Accurate tracking of total issues processed during session imports.
- **Pure Logic Refactor**: Extracted testable helpers for export and session data shaping.
- **Consistent Exports**: JSON, Markdown, and CSV exports now include all enriched traceability and remediation fields.

### Packaging

- Portable Windows executable output: `dist-electron-v4\MarkdownAuditor-portable.exe`
- **Security Note**: This build is unsigned. Windows may display a "Windows protected your PC" warning; users should select "More info" -> "Run anyway" to proceed.

## v1.0.0

Release date: 2026-03-29

Markdown Intelligence Auditor is now documented as a production-ready baseline for desktop Markdown auditing on Windows. This release brings the analysis pipeline, exports, and contributor docs into alignment with the actual runtime behavior.

### Highlights

- Production-grade normalization across both single-batch and multi-batch analysis runs
- Safer oversized-file handling through chunk-aware batching
- Incremental analysis with cache reuse for unchanged files
- Session diffing with `new`, `resolved`, and `changed` issue states
- Root-cause grouping, detector traceability, and structured remediation guidance
- Provider presets, timeout/retry/token-budget controls, and portable Windows packaging

### Included In This Baseline

- 32 analytical layers and 256 micro-detectors
- Four deterministic runtime escalation rules
- JSON repair plus response validation before rendering
- Search, filtering, grouping, export, and session save/load workflows
- Updated repository docs: README, architecture, contributing guide, enhancements, and Gemini instructions

### Packaging

- Portable Windows executable output: `dist-electron-v4\MarkdownAuditor-portable.exe`
- Packaging remains unsigned, so Windows trust prompts may still appear on some machines

### Recommended Next Steps

- Add code signing for release builds
- Move incremental cache storage from `localStorage` to a file-backed store
- Add stricter validation for optional schema fields
- Add automated regression tests for caching, diffing, and export behavior
